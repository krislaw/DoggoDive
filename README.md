# DoggoDive
Game Jam 2017 project co-created by @TheFireFerret (Sami Glasco) and @krislaw (Kris Lawton)

* MOVE: Arrow Keys or WASD
* FIRE: Space Bar

We made this project using the Unity Game Engine. This was our first time using Unity and C#, but we managed to make a cute 2D shooter within 48 hours!
